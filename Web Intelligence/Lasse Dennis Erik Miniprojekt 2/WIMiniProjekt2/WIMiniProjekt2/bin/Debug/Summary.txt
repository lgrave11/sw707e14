Review: It's coconut flavored, either you'll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion.

Summary: Hickory Smoked Way Too Salty!
Review: Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs.

Summary: Cute, small lollipops, a few arrived broken
Review: Got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party, so I haven't actually tasted them. The lollipops are cute . . . the wrappers have writing on them, which I wish they didn't (would have been much cuter without the writing). They are a bit smaller than I expected (just slightly larger than a regular lollipop), and a few arrived broken, but really, they were well packaged, and looked cute for the party.

Summary: Gluten free isn't  always taste free.
Review: Due to health issues, my husband is newly required to eat a gluten free diet. He acted as if he was on death row. Finding this product has help immensely. I can make him pancakes with fresh fruit and he doesn't feel he is being unfairly punished. Also, my neighbor was faced with a similar circumstance. I shared one of the boxes with her and she is now a fan! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>

Summary: Not So Great
Review: The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily.<br />The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.<br />I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.

Review: I purchased these because they do not contain dairy, soy or corn.  Well, in addition to being dairy free, soy free.... they are FLAVOR FREE!  Absolutely horrible dry tasting bars.  First words out of my mouth were "tastes like dirt" so that's what I'm going with.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

Summary: OK, not that flavorful
Review: The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.

Summary: Didn't think it would be good...but it is! GREAT!!
Review: My daughter has been GF for about 4 years now. We have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour, it usually isn't any good. It is usually grainy. This isn't the case with this product. It makes fantastic pancakes (the rest of the family would eat them). She didn't like the biscuits so we won't make those again.  We used it to make corn dogs and the entire family (and a friend) ate them. No one even noticed. Everyone LOVED them.<br /><br />Amazon has since taken this off of the Subscribe and Save. I am so mad. I hope they put it back on soon.

Summary: Horrible!
Review: So disappointed with this frosting.  The first time I used this frosting I was disappointed, but a year has gone by and I thought that maybe I had gotten a bad container.  I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!

Summary: False advertising!
Review: The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.

User: beatrisa
Summary: Not a fan of this blend
Review: Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by "that other chain" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.

Review: I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.

Summary: Arrived broken and isn't eligible for return?
Review: I just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that BOTH of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving/cooking plate.  They were busted completed in half. They were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box.  I went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return.  This is the first return I've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product, I can't do it.  I will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what isn't in the future.

Summary: We poured ours out
Review: Google "propylene glycol" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's "pure" and then there's "not so much".....<br /><br />from the website:  [...]<br /><br />Propylene Glycol<br /><br />A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water.

Summary: Sugar, lots. Maple, not so much
Review: The problem with this peanut butter is the use of "evaporated cane juice" which is a coy way of saying "raw sugar". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the "cane juice" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.<br /><br />I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.

Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...<br />UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{

Summary: So bad I had trouble giving it away!
Review: I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.<br /><br />I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?

Summary: 41 cents per 0.8 ounce is more than twice the regular price
Review: I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box.  The regular price is about $4.<br /><br />$28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box/nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce.  The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.<br /><br />On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box.  Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks.

Summary: A poor choice
Review: Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says "Not a significant source of protein."  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way.

Summary: Glorified baby food
Review: I know these are super trendy right now, and I totally wanted to love this product (or, to be more exact, I wanted my toddler to love this product). He took one taste, handed it back to me, and said, "Why you gave me baby food, mom?" I tasted it, and he is right. It tastes just like jarred baby food. Same consistency (not any thicker), too. If your kid likes the packaging, great. If your kid doesn't, then it is just really, really expensive baby food. I'm going to give the rest to my baby, as the toddler is not the least bit interested.

But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off.

Summary: Taste is neutral, quantity is DECEITFUL!
Review: The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor.

Summary: Not as flavorful as I imagined
Review: I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap.

If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware.

Review: In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didn't have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :(

Summary: Horrible
Review: I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food. Would never recommend.

Summary: new recipe gone bad
Review: I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad.

Summary: It's alright.
Review: I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me.

Summary: Not what I thought
Review: As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.<br /><br />I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.<br /><br />"Stacey"'s review sold me on it:<br /><br />"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with "meat by-product" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be "unfit for human consumption". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered "waste" and packaging it up as "healthy & nutritious" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not "sold-out" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of "aflatoxin poisoning" from the "healthy & nutritious" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as "Natural", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their "high priced waste" and heavily marketing it as "natural".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. "

Review: I usually order Bustelo Decaffeinated coffee and I am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso. I tried this Lavazza decaf espresso and I am extremely disappointed.

Review: My first time having Curry Rice.<br /><br />But boy, I cooked this stuff exactly how you're supposed to.<br /><br />Taste...wasn't bad, I guess, a little "Strong" though.<br /><br />IT was thick, like ice slush...it was over-bearing and the spice was pretty intense.<br /><br />I don't think I'll get it again...I guess it's good stuff, seen it in some curry making videos...used often, but...not for me, as it it is way to thick.<br /><br />I had potatoes, onions, and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it...and I could not taste them, at all. I could not taste the pork, or anything. Only the Sauce.

Review: I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.

Review: Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped.

Summary: Good quality - not 'getting' whatever flavor difference...
Review: I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.  I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work.

My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion.

Review: First of all, it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge.  On auto delivery, they are cheaper than the cheapest Senseo pods that I have found (Target/Walmart).  But check out the weight of coffee per Senseo pod vs. this particular Baronet coffee pod.  Not all Baronet pods are this weight, however, so check out the products carefully.  I guess I had better mention that the coffee flavor is great!  One order is for three boxes of these pods.

Summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
Review: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

Review: I thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market, called Izze, that has fewer calories, tastes better and costs less. However, Switch has a weird artificial aftertaste. It tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda, but not in a good way. Also, with 140 calories per serving (8.3 ounces) and 34 grams of sugar, you might as well drink soda- because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper.

Summary: Good, but not Wolfgang Puck good
Review: Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.

Summary: Some cans tastes good, others horrid
Review: I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge. (I know I should prob call the company and talk to them, but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and I am able - never happens!!)Thanks!

Summary: Too strong of flavors
Review: I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.

I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!

Review: Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix is very, very good.  However, know when you order in the small packages you are not getting the baking mix.  You are getting individual (or for two people) servings of pancake and waffle mix.  This formula is different than that for the larger packages of Baking and Pancake Mix and does not make biscuits, muffins, or other short breads very well, too sweet for my taste.  If you are looking for great tasting pancake or waffles in a smaller package, then this is for you.  If you are looking for a great baking mix as well as pancakes and waffles, then get the larger packages.

Still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day, but just not a great tropical/hibiscus tea.

Summary: Not Safe!
Review: After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!

Summary: Decent canned clam chowder
Review: I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.

Summary: Great packaging.  Decent price.  OK expiration date.
Review: These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.

Review: This review is for the packaging and not the actual mix, since the mix is a very subjective thing and my taste my not match others and, some wrote about how poor the packaging was. All I can say is with mine there is more than enough labeling, on the bags themselves and on the box there are instructions on how to. Granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags, there are more than enough instructions to go by.

The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.

Summary: NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!
Review: As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for "alive and aware raw cacao" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say "out of stock" or "currently unavailable" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the "brands" and "vendors" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said "alive and aware" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food "of the Gods" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!

Summary: Price nearly doubled in less than 2 months?
Review: I love these crackers but not the price change.<br /><br />At $29.00 for 12 boxes; ~$2.42 a box if you sign up for "Subscribe and Save" I was ecstatic. I most definitely signed up for "Subscribe and Save" delivery.<br /><br />Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.<br /><br />Bait and switch?<br /><br />I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period- I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat bread and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller-Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.<br /><br />As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I don't own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. It's one of the main reasons I'm a "Prime" member.<br /><br />I'll need to cancel my "Subscribe and Save" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasn't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.<br /><br />I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.<br /><br />It's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but I'm so disappointed!<br /><br />Looks like I'll be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo.

Summary: disapointed
Review: I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again.

Summary: Packed in the wrong oil.
Review: It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best.

Review: my wife and I are avid Keurig coffee fans (with three brewers between the two of us). We started out ordering all the flavored pods and soon learned than are likes were back to the basics ..... we each have a couple of "full" strength and then go to the "de-caf" for that last cup.<br /><br />Mahogany is my choice for the full blend.  It's smooth ....has an excellent taste and aroma.<br /><br />We are totally satisfied with this order .....

Summary: Weak, even on small cup setting
Review: This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.

Summary: good product, terrible packaging by Amazon.
Review: The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, "Well, what do you want me to do?"  "Uh, you're customer service... Service the customer???"  Amazon has lost my business forever.

Summary: Weird after taste, sugar substitute
Review: there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.

Summary: Weird texture; too dry and crumbly...
Review: I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are "No Gluten" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.

Summary: We couldn't tell the difference in a blind taste test.

Summary: A disappointment...
Review: I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro-toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldn't serve it to them for breakfast.  Just sayin...

User: Jimmie
Summary: Meh
Review: The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.<br /><br />I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store.

Summary: Really good product but not as good as "real" Bisquik
Review: I purchased this while out of town.  We used it a couple of times, but never for biscuits.  I did make pancakes out of it and they were pretty good.  Always use milk and butter.<br /><br />They are a bit heavy and have a slight slimy sense to them, but are significantly better than a lot of stuff out there. I did also use it to thicken some gravy and it was fabulous for that.  I used it for breading for chicken nuggets as well and it was good.  I would like to try this again  for pancakes, and make some biscuits before I make a final decision on it.

Summary: Carrot Juice???? Really????
Review: Talk about horrible . . .<br />I was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand I normally like which has what I like for ingredients: Carrot Juice.<br /><br />I did see before buying that it said it had Organic Lemon Juice in it when I looked at the ingredients but I figured that the makers would only add it if it didn't change the taste that much.  Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.  So now I'm wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here.<br /><br />If you want carrot juice this is NOT for you.  I don't even think they should call it that . . .<br /><br />I don't normally do it, but I am seriously considering taking this back to the supermarket.  I also think I should write a letter to the company because it is just that ridiculously bad.

Summary: Misleading product!!! If you want no bees, then use it.
Review: There's one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is NOT for use in containers! Why hide that info? To make more sales, of course. You'll only learn that if you read their Q & A on their website. I studied the labels and opened the back label and it's never mentioned you can't use it on potted plants. Thanks Bayer...now I have to go back to the store to return it. I guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died, not knowing it's because of this product. If you see your bees dwindle and disappear, then this is the reason. Will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers? After 3-4 years of use, they will not have a fragrance. Got earthworms? You wouldn't know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt. AVOID THIS!

Summary: Not very busy...
Review: My dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes. I think she basically ate it, which was a huge disappointment. We were hoping for something that we could give her that she would ENJOY, but also something that would last a bit longer. In addition to being more of a treat than a chew, these things are messy. She had it all over the floor around her,and all over her paws. It makes a sticky...goop that isn't very easy to clean up. I definitely won't buy these again, it's too expensive to only last 5 minutes.

Summary: At least it wasn't expensive.
Review: With <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.<br /><br />Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first "unofficial" producers of "we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.<br /><br />Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite "diet" or "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK">Splenda</a>" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />"Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want." and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious "diet" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this.

User: kelly
Summary: Way too SALTY!!
Review: The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.<br /><br />I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.<br /><br />Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt.

Summary: Unremarkable
Review: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

Summary: Not spicy enough.
Review: If you're used to Dave's Insanity sauce, or like me you're used to Dave's Ultimate Insanity sauce, you're going to be really disappointed. 5 of the 6 sauces aren't spicy at all. They're probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just can't get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce. I guess I have plenty of salad dressings.

Summary: Way too weak for my tastes
Review: What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.

Summary: No bitterness great flavor and it does work
Review: Tying to find a tea that didn't have that bitter taste was difficult; and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore.  I was trying many of the healing teas, but they had stevia added to them and I could not get past the taste of that.  This tea is not bitter, and has a very nice smooth flavor.  I have had it both hot and cold.  I do feel that I am energized after drinking it, but it is not a jittery hyper feeling; it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling.  Some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but I do not get that.  While I do not often add my 1/2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean; that you do not have to add sugar to it.  I have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and I even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee.  Excellent taste and an all around great product.

Summary: These sure don't taste like ketchup to me!
Review: I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!

Review: I bought these for my cat and if I give them to him, he'll eat them, but it's not the type of treat he'll do tricks for or run over to eat.

These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat.

Summary: Awful
Review: The only other flavored coffee I've used was Nestle Hazelnut. It too was a 5# whole bean.  I really enjoyed that one and thought I pick this one up.<br /><br />Where the Nestle's shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers.  This one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related. I like hazelnuts and this a isn't anything like hazelnut<br /><br />Now I have 5# of the stuff.  My mistake!<br /><br />More Info:<br />I am about 3/4 of the way through the bag.  My opinion has not changed.  Also, I would note a very inconsistent flavor.  Today's grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring.  It appears they really don't have the adding of flavoring down.  The intensity of the flavoring is all over the park.

Summary: Way Too Salty
Review: I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)

Review: Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work.

Review: a $5000.00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a $5000.00 car!  I don't buy from any supplier that ships by price.<br />This item is $7.95 then you pay $11.95 for up to $20.00 for shipping? No way I would pay that for one jar.

Review: I've been sampling as many sugar-free chocolates as I can find.  This one was okay but not the best.  I don't think what I got was the freshest either, as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar.  The BEST I've found so far is Cavalier brand at another website.

Review: Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.<br />Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup

Summary: It works, but not as expected.
Review: As other reviewers have pointed out, the effects vary from person to person. Each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour (longer for my sister)and while it did make things noticeably sweeter, the initial taste of something was identical, and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second. Oh, and sour/bitter drinks like Monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after. Don't try Apple cider vinegar, it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue, but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful.

Summary: Cocoa wasn't bad. . .Price was horrible
Review: The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(

It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.<br /><br />I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey.

Summary: Cats won't eat it
Review: I've been feeding Wellness grain-free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I'm off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness.

Review: Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious!

Summary: Sorry Wolfgang!
Review: I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great. Sorry Wolfgang, but I'm afraid this one is a yawner.

Summary: good product, terrible packaging by Amazon.
Review: The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, "Well, what do you want me to do?"  "Uh, you're customer service... Service the customer???"  Amazon has lost my business forever.

It arrived on time, however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper,without any protection for the plant.  The plant is completely smashed.

Summary: Variety matches the (current) picture
Review: As a new Keurig owner, I'm trying as many "sampler" packs as possible to determine what both my husband and I like the most.<br /><br />Although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other "Crazy Cups" purchases have been received in, I am enjoying this variety thoroughly.  It is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following:<br /><br />Southern Sweet Tea, Unsweetened Black Tea, Raspberry Sweet Tea, Peach Sweet Tea, Sweet Lemon Tea, Half & Half Tea and a few different iced coffee k-cups.  Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.<br /><br />I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k-cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I can't justify the cost.  However, this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes!<br /><br />If these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers, this would be a very ideal gift/house warming present for these hot summer months!  I don't mind them not being in a gift box, but I could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price.

Review: I just called Bob's Red Mill customer service (just do a G search for the company, their customer service number is under "contact us" on their site), and I was annoyed to learn that NONE OF BOB'S RED MILL BAKING SODA CONTAINS ALUMINUM. I've been paying $10-15 (with shipping) for this magical 'aluminum free' baking soda only to learn that the Bob's Red Mill 'premium baking soda' at my local grocery is the same exact thing. Call for yourself if you don't believe me. Ugh.

Summary: Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either
Review: My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda "Orange Crush," although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike "Orange Crush," this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase it.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.

Summary: The best bad breath and no fowl after taste
Review: Took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum, but when I found Wrigley's Orbit White peppermint the search ended. I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.<br /><br />Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. Not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. This won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. Wrigley; just never change the flavor!

Summary: OK, not that flavorful
Review: The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold-out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.

Summary: Never again
Review: I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.

Review: The product that I received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item's page.

So I wasted $30.00 and I am stuck with a case of "Soy Crisps" that I will not eat.

Summary: Did not work for me
Review: I've tried using a toaster/microwave/confection oven/stove to make these things myself, but I wasn't able to. I even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to "pop". I verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named Mat (his name has one "T", which seemed a little strange to me), but to no avail.<br /><br />I contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product! I don't know why they couldn't just mail, or at least email me some popping instructions.<br /><br />Luckily I think even raw/unpopped they taste pretty good. People look at them funny at first, but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag, completely unpopped...

User: patience
Summary: Not as good as I was lead to believe
Review: I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being "healthy" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well.

Summary: Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats
Review: For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!

If you've ever used Thai rice flour <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYC096">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz</a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.<br /><br />I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty.

The dogs- who will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, where is a zero star button?

Summary: Detailed reply from company over infant feeding and DHA/ARA
Review: MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One?.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic? formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic? formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic? falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic? formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic? formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials? DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials? DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, "The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children," Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic? formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Toll Free [...]

Review: This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was "natural flavor"  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all.

Summary: STALE.  Beware buying these on special!
Review: I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same.

Review: Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />"Enjoy Life" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.

Summary: Decent tasting, but too small and overpriced
Review: I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money.

Summary: Disappointed!!
Review: I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the "sampler" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or "the lack of variety" pack!

Summary: I do not even like kettle chips and I love these
Review: A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , "these will change your life!"  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you.

Review: I have been so happy with this product!  My baby girl has always had a sensitive tummy, up late hours w/ pains and crying with nothing to sooth her.

It organic and difficult to find at local stores in my area.  I found amazon to have the best price and its easy to have it delivered to the door.  Id suggest this formula to anyone!

Summary: Ugh.
Review: This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no "delicious" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds.

Summary: I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed
Review: Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.

Summary: Bland
Review: This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.

Summary: Didn't care for the variety selections
Review: I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order.

Summary: Kitty Junk Food
Review: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

Summary: Good, but not the best of the Nana's varieties
Review: I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.

Summary: Simply Nasty
Review: I bought this because I have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  I am not a health nut, I just can't eat gluten.  With that said, this is nasty.  It calls for very little sugar, I figure for the health nuts, so I simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste.  Even with extra sugar, it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  I would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again.  On a positive note, the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it, you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund.

Review: After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w/ their response.

Review: I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others.

Summary: Good Taste but Not for Everyone
Review: I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast.

Summary: Not quite Old Dutch but much better than Herr's
Review: I LOVE Old Dutch Ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the US and pricey on eBay.  I tried Herr's but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that Old Dutch has (makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many!).  Uncle Rays are decent - more of a kick - many "loaded" chips which I like, still, not the addictive bite I love.  So - if you love Herr's these may be too much for you.  If you love Old Dutch give these a shot.  I am still on my quest for something equal to Old Dutch!!

Review: This is the only way to fry fish.  If you start cooking with your fire too high, the fish will not get those annoying burn marks.  The fish fries evenly, a nice golden brown.  It adheres to the fish well and does not come off when flipping to the other side.  It tastes good.  I add a pinch of old bay seasoning and a pinch of sugar, shake up the mixture and then add the fish and shake again.  We have been using this stuff for years and I make perfect fish every time.
