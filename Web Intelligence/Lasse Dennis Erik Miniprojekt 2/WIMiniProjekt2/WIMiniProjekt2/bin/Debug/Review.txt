Review: There's nothing like a cup of black (espresso) coffee to end a meal. I don't know why it's not on the super market shelves anymore. My favorite way of using it, however, is cold with plenty of ice on a hot summer's day.

Review: I've been looking for ground celery seed for at least 2 years.  It used to be always be avaialbe at grocery stores with the rest of the spices, but for some reason stopped being there.  Regular celery seed is easy to find, but not the ground version.  So, I found online.  I wanted McCormick (or some familiar brand).  I'm very satisfied with what I ordered - it's very good and fresh.  My only complaint is that I couldn't purchase a smaller quantity than two large 16 oz containers.  I don't use that much, so gave away the one container to a friend, and it will take me years to use 16 oz container that I kept!  :)  But, happy to now have found.  Hope for others that McCormick decides to package in smaller quantities.

Summary: Great toddler snack; inconsistent quality
Review: My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product.

Summary: Worst cookies ever!!!!!
Review: I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage.

Summary: Great in juices/water mix!
Review: These are great in juice mix.  What I usually do is mix a tablespoon or two in a glass with half-way filled water.  Stir continuously for the next minute or two (this is to keep the seed separated so they don't stick together in small chunks, do this and they will float in the drink mix), then fill up the glass with your prefer choice of juice or organic juice (guava, prune, coconut, etc), stir in a tiny bit of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014J2UO">KAL - Pure Stevia Extract Powder, 3 oz powder</a>.  Let the drink sit for at least 15 minutes (remember to stir it every minute so that the gel coat on those seeds are formed evenly and they will float).  Drop in a cube or two of ice when ready to serve....you'll be amazed!

Summary: Great Starter plant
Review: Item arrived in less than a week. Packaging was great. Old newspaper to fill in black space, and the leaves of the plant were tucked inside of a clear plastic cup to keep them from getting crushed.  There was a disposable heat pack that was placed inside to raise the humidity.<br /><br />All leaves were green and healthy, not many traps were closed. It had two adult plant, one juvenile one. I separated them to give them more room in a hanging pot because the three inch pot wouldn't have been long enough for their roots (They like over 4 inches of room for their roots if it can be helped). Fast forward 6 months, my collections has grown, and these original Venus Fly Traps have  been propagating with secondary growth points. They're growing like weeds!<br /><br />Don't forget, they like sun and distilled water. But be careful when you first get them. Put them in partial shade for a few days to avoid sun burning.

Summary: Wonderful beef jerky...an addiction waiting to happen!
Review: I am not Muslim, but was interested in this jerky because of its low carb content compared to some other brands of "sweet" jerky out there.  It has a slightly sweet taste and great flavor (spicy...but NOT hot)!  It is easy to chew and doesn't leave your fingers sticky. I wish it came in more economical sizes (6, 9, or 12 oz sizes), but that doesn't seem to be the case.  It's a great jerky and might just be addictive, which probably makes the 3 ounces bag size a good choice...after the first 3 ounces you HAVE TO STOP (at least long enough to open another bag)!!!

Summary: eat a fig bar instead
Review: This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that "yogurt powder" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the "natural flavorings," etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a "vitamin blend" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again.

Review: I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true.

Summary: Sugar Free, Salty Goodness
Review: I love these soy crisps.  They are the perfect salty crunch.  I have a hard time finding snack foods that don't have wheat, corn, or some sort of sugar sweetener in them.  But these fit the bill.  They are *very* salty, tho. I like them that way, but if you're not used to it and can be kindof surprising.

Summary: Miracle? No. Fun? Absolutely!
Review: Bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house (for those curious, I live in Northern California).  I've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?  Maybe a good business venture.

Summary: O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple
Review: I have been buying ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple regularly for awhile now. I like the flavor and ordering it on line is very convenient. Also, I have had no problems with delivery.<br /><br />Unfortunately, IPROZON has just lost my business.  I didn't mind paying $15.00 for a case of 12.  I will not, however, pay $39.95 for a case of 12.  That is robbery.  I can walk into Fred Meyer Grocery and buy a case of 12 for $17.88.  Plus there are other sites still selling it for $15.00 per case.  I noticed IPROZON is still selling the other flavors of ONE coconut water for $15.00 for a case of 12.  So what on earth are they thinking.<br /><br />I am quite unhappy with having to trust one of these other sites with my credit card information, but I am willing to do that versus paying nearly $40 for a case of 12.  Quite ridiculous.

Summary: Not a fan of this blend
Review: Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by "that other chain" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.

Summary: I love this snack!
Review: I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)

Summary: Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others
Review: My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.

This is the first return I've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon (to the tune of several orders a month!) and yet the one time that I want to return a defective product, I can't do it.

I don't think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food, so I guess it's a winner.

Summary: About the only good thing..
Review: Is that these are 60 calories per serving, however, in all honesty, I didn't make it through a full serving.<br /><br />I was excited about these, they looked like a "grown up graham cracker".<br /><br />First problem was the smell. They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.<br />I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.<br />Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste. Seriously, it was awful.<br /><br />I tasted these about 45 minutes ago, and after drinking an entire bottle of water AND brushing my teeth, I CAN STILL TASTE IT.<br /><br />I'm glad these were an add-on, but they are still absolutely terrible. Their only redeeming quality is that they are cute. Not one single member of my family will actually eat them though, so this was definitely a waste of 3$. Had I known they would be this awful, I'd have just got a second bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007POA158">Hi I'm Skinny Sticks, Sweet Onion Multigrain, 7-Ounce</a>.<br />Only 30 cent more than these, but MILES better in taste.

Summary: A poor choice
Review: Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says "Not a significant source of protein."  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way.

Summary: Really nice - sweet but with a bit of a kick
Review: The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was broken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?

Review: at it's best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber !

Summary: Delicious Decaffeinated
Review: First off,  let me state that I am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type.  But I often have guests over who ask for de-caf, so I gave this a try.<br /><br />While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain "different" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: "it really is delicious for a decaf."<br /><br />The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.<br /><br />The package had to be snipped open with scissors --this is tightly packed!-- and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.<br /><br />I'll stick with regular coffee, but I'm sure my de-caf loving friends will enjoy this.

Review: These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.

Review: I expected more flavor from W. Puck. Though this coffee does taste good, it didn't have caramel flavor as expected. This is my opinion. Someone else may feel differently. The price is okay, I would not discount this product at all. It's a good product. Try it, you may like it.

Review: At my local Costco store, I bought Pace salsa numerous times. The salsa tastes feel rich and I love the jalepenos Pace puts in the salsa. Spicy, but not too the point where I'm sweating and can't enjoy my salsa and chips.<br /><br />The salsa doesn't feel watered down and this is a great "go to" salsa choice.

Review: I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic.

Summary: Healthy and versatile
Review: There are so many miracle health products out there it's hard to know what's for real.  But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag.<br /><br />***Health Benefits***<br />- extremely high concentration of omega-3 acids (more than salmon)<br />- complete protein!  What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that, meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body can't synthesize on its own. 1 serving (10g / 1 tbsp) = 2g protein -- higher than most other grains and seeds.  Other plant sources with complete protein = quinoa, soybean, buckwheat & hempseed<br />- good source of fibre & potassium & calcium<br />- 3x the iron than spinach<br />- low in cholesterol & sodium<br />- doesn't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and doesn't have estrogen-like effects<br /><br />***Uses & Taste***<br />Chia seeds taste pretty good!  Rather, there's no strong taste the way sesame does, so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry, or a thicker jelly-like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit.<br /><br />Ideas for use: In a salad, added to smoothies, in a breakfast granola or yogurt, in oatmeal, used as an egg replacement in baked goods, on sushi, to make iskiate (chia fresca) -- a Tarahumara energy drink, or just straight up have a spoonful.  I recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great.<br /><br />One thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth, so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them. :)<br /><br />***This brand***<br />I haven't bought any other brand of chia seeds, but this one works so why switch?  Seeds tasted fresh when I opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag.  Bag is resealable, price on Amazon was better than in stores = a good buy.<br /><br />Overall I'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking...next kitchen experiment - lemon chia cupcakes!  Bye bye poppy seeds!

Review: Cat grass is cat grass, and I have one cat that absolutely loves it; another that couldn't care less.  It's winter now, so I couldn't find it where I buy seeds, so I went on line.  Product is okay, service was prompt.  My disappointment: could only order one two-ounce package per shipping and handling fee.  Cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks, and I would have ordered 3 or 4 packages, but not at 3 or 4 times that shipping fee!

Summary: Taste is neutral, quantity is DECEITFUL!
Review: The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor.

Summary: Not as flavorful as I imagined
Review: I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap.

Summary: Tasted pretty much like Orange soda.
Review: For a beverage that is basically 100% fruit juice that has been carbonated, with no sweetners or preservatives added, Switch Orange Tangerine pretty much tasted to me like a can of Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.<br /><br />That isn't a bad thing, per se...but it was not something I would pay a premium for if I were in the mood for orange soda.  Presumably, it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda, but it is nothing special to taste, and thus I will not go through the effort to seek it out.<br /><br />(On the other hand, my 16 year old daughter claimed to like it MORE than orange soda, and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it.  As with many juices, even though it is orange "flavored"...grape juice is a major ingredient.  So she would give it four stars.)

Review: You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive "CERTIFIED" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware.

Summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
Review: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

Summary: Not NEARLY as strong as claimed!
Review: In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didn't have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :(

Summary: Sweet Coconut Flavor with A Mild Aftertaste.  Mild to Medium Blend.
Review: Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.<br /><br />This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size.

Summary: Just Right and you will love it!
Review: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

Summary: new recipe gone bad
Review: I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non-Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad.

Summary: Not what I thought
Review: As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.<br /><br />I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.<br /><br />"Stacey"'s review sold me on it:<br /><br />"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with "meat by-product" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be "unfit for human consumption". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered "waste" and packaging it up as "healthy & nutritious" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not "sold-out" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of "aflatoxin poisoning" from the "healthy & nutritious" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as "Natural", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their "high priced waste" and heavily marketing it as "natural".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. "

Summary: Pricey yet surprisingly refreshing!
Review: I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.<br /><br />The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a "cheap drinker" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96? per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12? per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6? per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8? per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it's about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process.

Review: This is a good gum to chew if you are looking to switch from sugared to sugarless gum. It's sweet, and doesn't have a strong aspartame taste, for being sugar-free. It doesn't last 'forever' like the commercials and 'Forever Fruit' name would lead you to believe, but the flavor lasts longer than a lot of sugarless gums, and it has a nice kick of flavor when you first bite in. Everyone in my family likes this flavor of Stride.<br /><br />Don't confuse this with the darker-but-similar-colored-packaging 'Mandarin' flavor.

Summary: I love these things!!
Review: I have never enjoyed my Keureg more!  They couldn't be easier to use and I'm so happy to be using my favorite coffee and making it to my own specifications.  Love these things!!<br /><br />Additional comment:  In reading the reviews I see some complaints about leakage, etc... one trick I have come to rely on is NOT to fill the kup all the way to the top with the coffee.  You need to leave some room at t the top so that the lid isn't touching the coffee inside (maybe a little less than 1/2cm from the top rim).  When I follow this protocol, I get a perfect cup every time.  When I fill it too high, I end up with leakage.  The only problem is that I usually need a cup of coffee int he morning before I can follow my own instructions.

Summary: Now that's orange
Review: This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be "100% juice," but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you.

Summary: Tight Fit
Review: The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine.

Summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
Review: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

Summary: Non-Flavored coffee drinkers beware!
Review: I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.

Summary: Good jerky
Review: As processed, mass produced jerkies go, this is one of the best I've had. It compares with King-B. I don't care for all of the poisonous preservatives and processing, but that comes with eating anything these days unless you go and find a hunter you can buy from direct.<br />Fresh game jerky would be the next logical step if you can find it.

Summary: Surprisingly delicious
Review: I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

Summary: Okay for a casual get together
Review: I keep these in the freezer when unexpected guests drop-in, or if one of the staff has guests.  What we do prefer is to slaughter the fatted calf, but that is not always practical due to anticipating aging times.  Having just said that, I realize that I must institute a detailed and precise slaughtering schedule to insure always having quality beef on hand.<br /><br />I may have given these Kobe steaks four stars if that were my only gripe, but I have a problem with  the size.  First off, these cuts are only one inch thick, which is ghastly offensive.  I steak should be, at the bare minimum, two inches thick.  I do not even associate with proletarians, and can only imagine the horrors that these "people" committ against decent food.  Can't these people just eat sensibly, or not at all.  Please don't get me started, for I wanted to include sterility drugs in all fast food, particularly the bargain menu, but that is merely a hope and dream for another day.<br /><br />Secondly, isn't there a law somewhere about a steak less that  two pounds?  My heavens, this fourteen ouncer is a mere sampler, a tease.  I suppose these cuts are intended to be given away at those offensive stores that the yuppies flock to as lemmings to a cliff.<br /><br />Lastly, I must close this review before I become too distraught.

Summary: Disgusting, nasty, inedible
Review: I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry.

Summary: If you like gummy white bread . . . .
Review: White bread is not my thing, so that's probably why I don't like this one.  I like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads, but otherwise I always choose whole grains.  This one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor.  Not interesting at all to me.

Review: I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa.

Review: Very high quality dulce de leche from Argentina. Compared to most brands, it's a bit lighter colored, and the taste is more subdued and milkier. You may or may not appreciate this, as it's not the classic taste that you expect from commercial dulce de leche, but it's by far the closest to the homemade dulce that my grandma used to make. For this, I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

Summary: Best stevia product I ever used
Review: I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.<br /><br />I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good.

Review: We live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can't be found locally.  This gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on.  I'm going to order a few more of these because I never want to run out of it.

Summary: Big Disappointment
Review: I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!

Summary: Mediocre
Review: This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.

Review: This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.

It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity.

Summary: Nice for a late night cup
Review: My wife finds it bizarre that I enjoy a good cup of joe just before I call it a night. Yeah, sometimes I get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so I thought I'd give this decaff a go. What you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it's a little weak and I recommend dropping about 50% more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor. Also, as it's vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat - nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot. I know it's a minor thing to complain about but I like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldn't even stand up. It was about 1/2" thick!<br /><br />So you're not going to have Mr Wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it ain't half bad.

Summary: there are much better gluten and dairy free cookies
Review: My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk.

Review: I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was "diet" or "low calorie".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.<br /><br />Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products.

Summary: Miracle berry + lemons = AWESOMENESS
Review: I was researching the miracle berry protein miraculin for a research proposal, so I decided to give these tablets a try. The effect was immediate, and lasted approximately 20 min for me and my coworkers. Everyone was completely in love with the lemons, and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well. For some the effect was actually too sweet, and they gave up after a few foods. Other foods/beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries (lost their tartness), red wine vinegar (sweet on the tongue, but not so great in the throat) and Corona (loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it). It certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid, but it's a great parlor trick to share when you are entertaining.

Summary: Great boost!
Review: I love this stuff!  I sit in front of a computer all day at work, it's easy to get tired, not to mention I've always had trouble sleeping, so I never get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep, more like an average of 4 or 5 hours per night.  I was surprised at how quickly it boosted me but I certainly didn't feel the shakes or jittery at all.  I felt more awake, and I didn't crash from it later.  It wears off gradually after a few hours but it helps to get through the main part of the day.  I don't use it every day but on occassion when I need a boost.

Summary: Decent canned clam chowder
Review: I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.

User: guenevere

Review: I am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product. I'm not too much of a fan of the Caramel Dip, but the syrup is equally as delicious as its Pancake counterpart. I highly recommend it, but ask your local grocers to see if they're willing to carry it. This is far too expensive than what I paid going to my grocery store.

Review: Bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur (sp) for his dog.  The dog didn't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose.  Not sure, but it appears to have a very salty, brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses.  However, it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over, along with their master!

Summary: Great packaging.  Decent price.  OK expiration date.
Review: These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon.

Review: This review is for the packaging and not the actual mix, since the mix is a very subjective thing and my taste my not match others and, some wrote about how poor the packaging was. All I can say is with mine there is more than enough labeling, on the bags themselves and on the box there are instructions on how to. Granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags, there are more than enough instructions to go by.

Summary: Delicious
Review: Like Izze, the basic idea here is soda made with actual fruit juice. No sugar, no HFCS, no preservatives, no coloring; just 100% fruit juice concentrate and sparkling water. Fruits listed are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola (whatever that is).<br /><br />Intriguingly, the can mentions "contains soy" at the end of the ingredients list. There's no protein content listed, so it must be a trace amount. Something to bear in mind if you have a soy allergy, however.<br /><br />Flavor is fantastic. I'd have a hard time choosing between it and Izze, but I think I might just give Switch the edge.

Summary: Light, sparkling fresh peach flavor !!
Review: I love Kristian Regale Black Currant sparkling drink- so thought I'd try the peach.  I never know if I'm going to get a syrupy sweet flavor when I get peach flavored items, but this was really good- somewhat tart, and tastes like fresh peaches.  The bubbles are tiny- so not like regular sodas, but a 'grown up' sparkling beverage.  I will order this again, and would have no trouble giving this as a gift- if I didn't drink it all first !!  I hope Amazon gets the pear flavored (not the listing for 50+ bucks, either.  I'm sure that would be good as well... but the peach and black currant are definite winners !!

Summary: Price nearly doubled in less than 2 months?
Review: I love these crackers but not the price change.<br /><br />At $29.00 for 12 boxes; ~$2.42 a box if you sign up for "Subscribe and Save" I was ecstatic. I most definitely signed up for "Subscribe and Save" delivery.<br /><br />Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.<br /><br />Bait and switch?<br /><br />I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period- I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat bread and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller-Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.<br /><br />As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I don't own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. It's one of the main reasons I'm a "Prime" member.<br /><br />I'll need to cancel my "Subscribe and Save" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasn't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.<br /><br />I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.<br /><br />It's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but I'm so disappointed!<br /><br />Looks like I'll be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo.

Review: It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.

Summary: Fantastic!  Cured My Pregnancy Heartburn
Review: WOW!  I didn't expect that this would work last night, but it did!  I had the worst case of heartburn at 10 weeks along, and after not being able to eat dinner and 4 tums, it wasn't getting any better.  My best friend just bought me the Earth Mama Angel Baby tea sampler the other day and I had a lightbulb moment, remembering the heartburn tea was in there.  I figured it was worth a shot, not having eaten dinner and feeling nauseous and miserable.  Within a half an hour, the tea helped me to let out a couple of good burps and the hearburn finally eased.  I'm not usually so excited about something to go out and write a review, but am hoping this might help some other mamas 2 be in need as well.  I am putting in an order to get some more of this today.  Will be good to have a box on hand at home and at work.  The taste is very nice too, so I am beyond pleased!

Summary: good product, terrible packaging by Amazon.
Review: The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.

Summary: Convenient
Review: Following a plant based diet, I use tofu almost daily.  It is expensive to purchase at a store and takes up valuable real estate in my fridge.  These packages sit perfectly on a shelf.  They are a little smaller than standard refrigerated tofu (12 oz vs 16 oz).  They are also silk tofu so they don't hold  their shape as well, which is good for certain things like fried rice or chocolate mousse.  Not great if you are making tofu steaks or strips.

Review: I've been using this "low acid" coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste, I enjoy not having an "acid stomach", especially the "morning after".  To me, there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.

Summary: Weird after taste, sugar substitute
Review: there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.

Review: I really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half & half for creaminess. Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon.

Summary: good coffee - brews hot
Review: finally some new varieties of tassimo ... I drink everything from DD to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway .. this one is pretty much right on with the description - dark brew good medium body - it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all, reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans (but I like this better than the sbux house coffee..it's not quite as edgy), and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for Tassimo that I just don't like b/c of their aftertaste (bitter, to me) .. this one brews at 190 degrees (at least mine did), which is a bit hotter than I would make a cup of latte for example (at 160) so be careful on that first sip!  but I do think this one's a keeper...

Summary: Weird texture; too dry and crumbly...
Review: I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are "No Gluten" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.

Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really.

Summary: Carrot Juice???? Really????
Review: Talk about horrible . . .<br />I was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand I normally like which has what I like for ingredients: Carrot Juice.<br /><br />I did see before buying that it said it had Organic Lemon Juice in it when I looked at the ingredients but I figured that the makers would only add it if it didn't change the taste that much.  Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.  So now I'm wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here.<br /><br />If you want carrot juice this is NOT for you.  I don't even think they should call it that . . .<br /><br />I don't normally do it, but I am seriously considering taking this back to the supermarket.  I also think I should write a letter to the company because it is just that ridiculously bad.

Review: I was shocked to see that the bulk version of these Jelly Belly's are just in a cardboard box, no plastic, no nothing. Doesn't seem overly hygienic. Since I didn't open the box for a few months the Jelly Belly's were getting softer and crystallizing [unbeknownst to me] because we live in a wet climate. Hmmm...just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded

Review: This is a great idea, but i find that the grounds get into the coffee, and the coffee doesn't come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups.  It is messy as it comes out and misses the mug.  It still is nice but is not quite as good as the orginal.

Summary: Quailty coffee for the region and price
Review: I have a Keurig coffee maker. You know, the one with the K-Cups.  To have a coffee like this, you have to have a special filter, which I do have.  Honestly, you'll spend a crapload of money on K-cups if you don't get the filter for regular ground coffee.  Anyway, I don't know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way, but the water in my Keurig had a hard time seeping through, causing a bit of an overflow.  Aside from that, the taste was smooth and flavorful.  It has a coffee taste, plain and simple.  Is it anything special, not really.  It just tastes good and is reasonably priced.

Summary: Misleading product!!! If you want no bees, then use it.
Review: There's one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is NOT for use in containers! Why hide that info? To make more sales, of course. You'll only learn that if you read their Q & A on their website. I studied the labels and opened the back label and it's never mentioned you can't use it on potted plants. Thanks Bayer...now I have to go back to the store to return it. I guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died, not knowing it's because of this product. If you see your bees dwindle and disappear, then this is the reason. Will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers? After 3-4 years of use, they will not have a fragrance. Got earthworms? You wouldn't know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt. AVOID THIS!

Summary: Reduced spit-up and a happier baby!
Review: This formula is a life-saver!  Our 2-month old had a little viral bug, which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy.  With this formula, he barely spits up at all and has been so much happier!<br /><br />Ask your doctor for a sample!  When we took our baby in for his tummy troubles, the doc gave us a full-sized can of this formula to take home and try!  Considering it costs about $14 retail, this was great!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Reduced spit-up and gas<br />Reduced fussiness<br />Easy to mix up<br /><br />Cons:<br />Baby can't go as long between feedings, probably because it's easier to digest<br /><br />You can also get 2 free cans of Similac (one Advance and one Sensitive) by mail if you register at their website.  Great product and great customer service!

Summary: Not very busy...
Review: My dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes. I think she basically ate it, which was a huge disappointment. We were hoping for something that we could give her that she would ENJOY, but also something that would last a bit longer. In addition to being more of a treat than a chew, these things are messy. She had it all over the floor around her,and all over her paws. It makes a sticky...goop that isn't very easy to clean up. I definitely won't buy these again, it's too expensive to only last 5 minutes.

Summary: It's like Buttah!
Review: Okay, not like the butter most people would expect, but a very smooth, full and slightly savory vegetal flavor. The first time you take a sip, you might not notice it, but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip. The more you drink it, the more it will become apparent. It is very soothing to the pallet.<br /><br />Jin Xuan Golden Lily Oolong from Summit Tea Company it a good if not great tea, especially for the price and quantity you get. A solid every day drinker. It is not as complex as some that I've had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you brew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4-5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the broth is soft and sweet.<br /><br />If you like your Oolongs more on the green side, then you should give it a try. I know I'll be ordering another tin.

Summary: At least it wasn't expensive.
Review: With <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.<br /><br />Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first "unofficial" producers of "we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.<br /><br />Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite "diet" or "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK">Splenda</a>" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />"Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want." and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious "diet" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this.

User: kelsi
Summary: Great taste, safe & Natural
Review: I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is "store fat!" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the "during taste" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!

No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non-dieters will like it for the convenience.

Summary: Generally a good product, but quality is NOT consistent
Review: I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.<br /><br />This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.<br /><br />I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you don't get stuck like I did.

Summary: Great Starter plant
Review: Item arrived in less than a week. Packaging was great. Old newspaper to fill in black space, and the leaves of the plant were tucked inside of a clear plastic cup to keep them from getting crushed.  There was a disposable heat pack that was placed inside to raise the humidity.<br /><br />All leaves were green and healthy, not many traps were closed. It had two adult plant, one juvenile one. I separated them to give them more room in a hanging pot because the three inch pot wouldn't have been long enough for their roots (They like over 4 inches of room for their roots if it can be helped). Fast forward 6 months, my collections has grown, and these original Venus Fly Traps have  been propagating with secondary growth points. They're growing like weeds!<br /><br />Don't forget, they like sun and distilled water. But be careful when you first get them. Put them in partial shade for a few days to avoid sun burning.

Summary: No bitterness great flavor and it does work
Review: Tying to find a tea that didn't have that bitter taste was difficult; and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore.  I was trying many of the healing teas, but they had stevia added to them and I could not get past the taste of that.  This tea is not bitter, and has a very nice smooth flavor.  I have had it both hot and cold.  I do feel that I am energized after drinking it, but it is not a jittery hyper feeling; it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling.  Some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but I do not get that.  While I do not often add my 1/2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean; that you do not have to add sugar to it.  I have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and I even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee.  Excellent taste and an all around great product.

Summary: Love the Earth's Best brand usually, but...
Review: I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!<br /><br />The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up).

User: Lanny
Summary: Exactly what is claims to be!
Review: I really liked this drink.  It's 100% juice with no added sugar, so even though the sugar content is a little high, it has more nutrients than soda will have any day.  Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.  But beware - each can is only 8.3 ounces, a little more than a cup.  You decide if it's worth it.

Summary: Surprisingly good and no nausea!
Review: I didn't have high expectations that I would like this but I love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid. I am a Starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good. Nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee, this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous. I still prefer the taste of Starbucks houseblend but now I'm not sure the extra body is worth the acid. This is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it. Give it a try!

Summary: These sure don't taste like ketchup to me!
Review: I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the brands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!

Summary: Just Right and you will love it!
Review: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

Summary: A Tasty, Mildly Carbonated Fruit Juice Soda
Review: This is almost the kind of fruit soda I'd make if I were going into this business. The difference is that I'd go the Odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange/tangerine juices. Since it's a carbonated beverage I'd probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldn't have to be shaken before drinking. That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price it's being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine).<br /><br />For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados).  There's acacia gum (as a stabilizer probably, don't want to have to shake a carbonated drink) and then additional natural colors and flavors, ascorbic acid and soy.<br /><br />My 13yo daughter and I shared a can and liked the taste.  On a par with Orangina. My personal preference would be for a little more carbonation, but this was ok. I'm a traditionalist so I definitely prefer a 12oz. can, the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped, but then, I prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor.  Cheers!

Summary: My Dog Loves This Food
Review: My little Lhasa Apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago, so I found Merrick's Grammy's Pot Pie to be low glycemic, and decided to try it. He loves this food! It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadn't seen the delivery woman drop it off. I'm also disabled, and if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldn't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help. Many of the cans were also extremely dented. Delivering items this way is not acceptable. I would have given this review 5 stars if it hadn't been for the delivery.

Summary: Good, but container could be better
Review: I used to buy the Wholesome Sweetners agave and like it a little better, but switched because it became too expensive. So this is the cheeper option. The taste is the same, but it seems a little less sweet because I find I have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee. I don't like the container. It doesn't pour well, so I have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle, so that I don't have a sticky mess on my counter every day. It's fine for the price. I continue to have it shipped to me every other month.

Summary: Bite sized
Review: I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.

Review: The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container.

Summary: Keurig DisposaKups
Review: I have read mixed reviews on the DisposaKups, so I had no expectations.  I would like to say that the product has worked perfectly.  Maybe the issue with some users is that they are not pressing the lid on tight enough or are not allowing the filter to hang over the edge and be sealed in place by the lid.  There was NO leaking at all and I have used 10 cups already.  I also read that the coffee does not seem to be as strong as regular brew.  That is true, probably due to the type of grind.  My resolution to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place, but choose the smallest cup on the Keurig, which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee.  Lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup.  Viola!  Perfect.  I definitely recommend and will certainly purchase again.

Summary: Awful
Review: The only other flavored coffee I've used was Nestle Hazelnut. It too was a 5# whole bean.  I really enjoyed that one and thought I pick this one up.<br /><br />Where the Nestle's shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers.  This one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related. I like hazelnuts and this a isn't anything like hazelnut<br /><br />Now I have 5# of the stuff.  My mistake!<br /><br />More Info:<br />I am about 3/4 of the way through the bag.  My opinion has not changed.  Also, I would note a very inconsistent flavor.  Today's grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring.  It appears they really don't have the adding of flavoring down.  The intensity of the flavoring is all over the park.

Review: I'm not one to believe in supplements, but this product was the only thing that helped my anxiety. I was getting really bad panic attacks from what my doctor said was anxiety.

Review: Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work.

Review: I've been sampling as many sugar-free chocolates as I can find.  This one was okay but not the best.  I don't think what I got was the freshest either, as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar.  The BEST I've found so far is Cavalier brand at another website.

Summary: Best sour cream & onion chip I've had
Review: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

Review: I can't remember when I've had a cup of coffee so delicious, I immediately wanted another cup.  There is no bitter taste, no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees, no odd aftertaste.  It's just a mellow, gorgeous, hazelnut-with-a-touch-of-the-islands cup of coffee.  Outstanding.  My favorite I've ever tried, and I've tried most!

Summary: A taste that needs to be acquired...
Review: I have never had sea salt before but the 95% sodium free got to me.  It has to be an acquired taste because I don't really like it --- perhaps if I used it regularly I would not want to go back --- and, perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well...

Summary: It works, but not as expected.
Review: As other reviewers have pointed out, the effects vary from person to person. Each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour (longer for my sister)and while it did make things noticeably sweeter, the initial taste of something was identical, and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second. Oh, and sour/bitter drinks like Monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after. Don't try Apple cider vinegar, it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue, but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful.

Review: Love these popchips.  They are all great.  Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors.  I wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase I make (and I've made alot!).  The BBQ, Original, Salt & Vinegar and Sour cream & onion chips are superb!

Summary: Not my favorite product.
Review: I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic.

Summary: Cats won't eat it
Review: I've been feeding Wellness grain-free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I'm off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness.

Summary: the only jarred baby food my son ate
Review: From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.

Summary: Tastes like an energy drink
Review: I was surprised at the ingredient list and "100% natural" stamped on the side, because this drink tasted just like a compeletely artifical energy drink. This is going to be a short review for me, because I don't really have much else to say. I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.<br /><br />I know this isn't an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can't reconcile the taste with the ingredients. If you're the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks "I really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical enegry drink instead of natural fruit juice", then this is the product you've been dreaming of.

Summary: Premium made in the USA treats for dogs & cats!
Review: One of the few chicken jerky type treats out there that's made in the USA (Connecticut) and isn't made in China.  Time and time again there are recalls for these types of treats that come from CHINA.  Do NOT buy treats made in China for your pets!  Sure, these are a tad more expensive, but in the long run it will save you money by not having vet bills and save the health of your pet!  I call it kitty and dog candy!  They come running from any room in the house when they hear the bag open.  They LOVE Bravo's real meat treats!

Summary: MAMMA MIA!!!!
Review: Wow, I DID NOT EXPECT such a quick, shocking result from this product, but it definitely delivers!!! My brother told me about these tablets and the "flavor tripping" parties. I had never heard of them before, but decided to give it a try just because the claim sounded so wildly strange, a sort of "Ripley's Believe it or not" kind of novelty.<br />Anyway, the tablets WORK immediately. I just took one, had a lemon, and voila': it's SWEET! I also tried a sip of Chianti wine.. SWEET.... I poured a spoonful of white vinegar in a small glass of water... SWEET... I haven't tried beer or other things, but sooner or later I will!<br />The best thing I see coming out of this is that I FINALLY don't need to sweeten my tea! I'll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that.<br />Hmmm... perhaps I can add lemon juice to soda water and it can turn into a new diet soft-drink!! The possibilities are endless!

Summary: Bitter taste
Review: I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others.

Summary: Good stuff
Review: Researched the company, researched the ingredients. Customer Service people are great. Sent free coupons when e-mailed with a question about which of their cat foods best for my two kitties (regular or advanced).  Received good answers and not rote replies. This food is made in the USA with products from the USA and has all the ingredients I think are good for my cats. The two of them love, love this dry food and I have to ration it or they would chow day all day. I don't leave food out for any pet, cat or dog, to eat at will. They do not like Newman's canned food however so I don't force it on them.

Summary: Great product just need to adjust the subscription.
Review: My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.

Summary: good product, terrible packaging by Amazon.
Review: The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, "Well, what do you want me to do?"  "Uh, you're customer service... Service the customer???"  Amazon has lost my business forever.

Summary: Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either
Review: My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda "Orange Crush," although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike "Orange Crush," this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase it.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.

Summary: The best bad breath and no fowl after taste
Review: Took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum, but when I found Wrigley's Orbit White peppermint the search ended. I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.<br /><br />Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. Not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. This won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. Wrigley; just never change the flavor!

I am 10 weeks pregnant and haven't felt like eating much these last few weeks, but tonight, the night before I have to fast for a blood draw, I was craving some banana moon pies.  Off to the store I went and bought a box of these mini moon pies - the perfect size!!  You don't feel as bad eating two of them because they are so small, and eating 4 of them is kinda like eating 2 of the bigger ones, not that I did that or anything.  haha  Go get your banana moon pies today - you won't regret it!!

Summary: Flavor getting better, energy is great
Review: I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots.

So I wasted $30.00 and I am stuck with a case of "Soy Crisps" that I will not eat.

Review: I am amazed at the consistent flavor of Melitta coffees. Seriously, I sip any Melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same. Not bad coffee, always a darker roast and a deep flavor, but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package. The Riviera Sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee, perfect for an after dinner treat.

Summary: Did not work for me
Review: I've tried using a toaster/microwave/confection oven/stove to make these things myself, but I wasn't able to. I even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to "pop". I verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named Mat (his name has one "T", which seemed a little strange to me), but to no avail.<br /><br />I contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product! I don't know why they couldn't just mail, or at least email me some popping instructions.<br /><br />Luckily I think even raw/unpopped they taste pretty good. People look at them funny at first, but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag, completely unpopped...

Summary: Switch Flashback to my childhood - bad memories man
Review: There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those "single shot" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.

Summary: It's decent
Review: I originally ordered two teas from Art of Tea - the Silver Needles and the Coconut Creme. When my package came in, they had shipped the Coconut Creme and mistakenly bundled it with this Mandarin Silk tea by accident. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the Silver Needles and told me I could "dispose of the Mandarin Silk Oolong as I saw fit." Well, since I'm never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.<br /><br />This isn't a bad tea, first off. I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent tea. I don't think I'll order it again, but I'll certainly finish off this tin.

Review: I bought a Belgian waffle maker sort of on a whim and I was then confronted with the question: What waffle mix do I use? Somehow "Hungry Jack" felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price, Stonewall would be a great choice. Bang! Nailed it the first time. Now, I don't know if my waffle maker is particularly large/deep, but I get only two and one half waffles out of each batch (following the recipe on the label). I don't dare water it down to try to stretch it out and I figure I only got about 10 batches of waffles out of one can. The cost-per-waffle is steep, but these have never failed to come out light on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside, and they have NEVER stuck to the waffle iron. Grudgingly, even though I see the price has gone up a dollar per can, I will be reordering, but if it goes up any higher, I may have to try another brand.

Review: I love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode!!  The glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes.  Very hard to clean up.  Do not think I will buy this brand again!

Summary: Exactly like in Argentina ...
Review: My father grew up in Argentina and since he came to the States has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood. He doesn't have to search anymore, I bought him a couple of jars this past Christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since.

Summary: Guess I'm in the Minority
Review: I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance.  Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce.  Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters.

Summary: Very Dissapointed
Review: The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit, covered for 5min. It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container.

Summary: Good water only comes with a price...
Review: I continue to buy this water (as well as the larger size bottle) for a number of reasons:<br />1) The taste of the water is just plain good, refreshing, crisp and clean - it's not easy describing water that doesn't actually offend!<br />2) Our filtered municipal water still sucks and this is an excellent alternative for someone with health issues<br />3) The UPS guy does all the heavy work for me - all I have to do is put it away<br />4) I never have to run out of bottled water by availing of the discounted subscribe and save program<br />If I had any complaint at all it would be that the plastic bottle itself is quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpack.<br />Bottom line for me, the taste and convenience are worth the price and I'll continue to buy it as long as my budget allows.**UPDATED note** I've been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing: my local Kroger had Ozarka Spring Water on sale so I picked up a case - wow was that ever a mistake. Even though the Ozarka bottles are very light weight, the taste of the water is so different from TalkingRain Spring Water in that there is a distinct "plasticy" flavor. I've alway enjoyed the Ozarka in the past but had no idea I was settling for drinking "plastic" water...my goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on TalkingRain Spring Water...I am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now.

Summary: My cats go wild for this stuff.
Review: I'd been feeding them Wellness until the recent recall. After checking some reviews, I looked around for something comparably healthy in the large size cans and decided to give this a shot. They're always enthusiastic at mealtimes, but they've been literally climbing over each other at mealtimes for this. One caveat: Unlike the Wellness it has a pull tab, which is good news/ bad news. No need to mess with a can opener, but it's absolutely impossible to get it out without a spoon or a huge mess.

Summary: More Grammy Pot Pie Please!!
Review: I switched to Merrick dog food several years ago (2007) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison - specificlly Aminopterin - and was getting worse by the day.<br /><br />My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed "scrap" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to "re-label" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!<br /><br />I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the "smaller" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at "perfect levels" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever! My only regret is that I did not start feeding my little four-legged one Merrick sooner!

Summary: Au Gratin Potatoes
Review: January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect ... The au gratin potatoes I had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly wasn't it ... I opened the box and got out my skillet. The first thing that I noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. I browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. To my surprise, they were very tasty. Texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. I liked them alot. I think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... I give these 4 stars.

Summary: Not a Fan
Review: Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be...It is literally a two-bite bar.  Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.

Summary: Great quality food and my cats LOVE it.
Review: I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune. After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain "Menadione Sodium Bisulfite" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.

User: Ronald
Summary: Fabulous!
Review: My husband and I have been on a low carb diet for two years and I miss pasta most of all. We've tried other low carb pastas and weren't crazy about them, but we loved Fiber Gourmet. The taste is midway between white and whole wheat pasta. Unlike other low carb pastas, we didn't experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues (if you know what I mean). I can't wait to try other products from Fiber Gourmet.

Summary: holy cheapness!
Review: I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container.

Summary: Works with a caveat
Review: In reading the reviews here it is obvious that different tastebuds are affected very differently.  At first I believed the tablets did nothing even though I used a whole one.  Bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me.  Sweet foods and drinks didn't taste any sweeter.  I was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again.  It was when I drank pure lemon juice that I noticed a difference.  Pure lemon tasted like lemonade.  So the product does work, it just may not work exactly as advertised for you.

Summary: I hope I just got a bad batch
Review: This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was "natural flavor"  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all.

Summary: STALE.  Beware buying these on special!
Review: I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same.

Summary: ABSOLUTELY VILE!!!
Review: Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />"Enjoy Life" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.

Summary: Take a moment for yourself.
Review: This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. A teaspoon in a cup is sufficient. Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.

User: shandra
Summary: Great taste, less sodium
Review: The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet.

User: Shane
Summary: Decent tasting, but too small and overpriced
Review: I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money.

User: sharlene
Summary: Love this stuff!!
Review: This brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don't think it's carried by any of the major supermarket chains. I discovered it at Au Bon Pain and noticed that unlike other brands I've tried, this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added, it's just pure unadultered coconut water, so the quality can't get much better. The other thing i really like about it is that it's a glass container rather than paper or plastic, so the taste is not compromised. These things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things I would suggest to make it even better. First, this isn't really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there's pulverized, very small, drinkable pieces floating in the liquid; these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking. To me, this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you'd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink. Second, 9.5 ounces doesn't go a long way, I'd like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz, I'd then feel like I'm getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better.

Summary: Ugh.
Review: This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no "delicious" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds.

Summary: Surprisingly delicious
Review: I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

User: sibelle
Summary: I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed
Review: Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.

Review: Bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house (for those curious, I live in Northern California).  I've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />When I got the package, I popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved.  As for the flavor, if any of you have had Haw Flakes from any Asian market, that's what it tastes like.  For those who don't know, don't worry, it's nothing disgusting.  Kinda bland, to be honest.  After is dissolved, the first thing I tried was a lime.  Verdict: Sweet.  Not overly sweet, but still sweet.  Kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing.  Next up, apple cider vinegar.  Verict: Sweet.  Doesn't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say, but I see what they're saying.  Last test is cheese.  It tasted different, but not exactly a big change.<br /><br />As for how long it lasted, I would say after 30-45 minutes, it started to fade.  After an hour, it was gone.<br /><br />Bottom line, it was fun to try it out and I will definitely be trying out more things in the future.  As for hosting a flavor-tripping party?  Maybe a good business venture.

Summary: These cups melted during the coffee brewing process.
Review: I was so excited to get these k cups and immediately filled 10, for future brewing, with my favorite coffee.  I tried one right away...  the coffee started running down the front of my Kreuig.  I thought I had filled the cup wrong and maybe not had the lid sealed well enough.... but when the coffee was done I opened the k-cup slot and found a melted wrinkled container.  I have subsequently tried more of the orrigional 10 that I filled, after carefully checking that they were properly put together, and all melted in the same way.  I have since thrown the rest away because I was tired of the mess they created!  Don't buy these... they do not stand up to hot water.

Summary: Worked great for my cat
Review: This is a great food and my cat loves it! The only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches, and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans. Seriously, it looks like a different food, with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture, and the 5 ounce cans looking much more "grainy". I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...<br /><br />I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).<br /><br />Well, what do you know, the steroids didn't help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.<br /><br />I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn't seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don't have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM">Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0">Warren Laboratories - George's Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid</a>

Summary: Adzuki beans
Review: Adzuki ( or Azuki) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets. You can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30-40 min, (changing the water out at least twice) draining and mashing the beans with sugar.(strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins)  What you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream, fill pasteries or stuff into Mochi Cakes.

Summary: ABSOLUTELY VILE!!!
Review: Imagine taking some kids' playground chalk, perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks. Then scoop it up and put it in your mouth.<br /><br />That's how disgusting this bar is.<br /><br />I have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful, IT HAS NONE. I've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent.<br /><br />This neanderthal-era gluten free bar is so bad I want to go to my local grocery store, take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store (perhaps, if there's a trash compactor?) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product.<br /><br />Save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else.<br /><br />"Enjoy Life" bars? Being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth.

Summary: Hickory Smoked Way Too Salty!
Review: Wow. The hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. I could not even eat half of the stick. I have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. They are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. Avoid these at all costs.

Summary: Now that's orange
Review: This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be "100% juice," but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you.

Summary: Horrible: did something happen?
Review: I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.

Summary: best ever!
Review: This is a GREAT waffle mix! I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and "all the chemicals"--read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need, such as levening, and when you use REAL butter, NOT the "tub" butter that contains water and other nasty stuff, these are THE BEST WAFFLES EVER!

Summary: Good product
Review: These cups are usable as stated.  They are exactly what I was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee.  They do leak slightly but not too bad. Not sure if it makes the hole's a little larger than the prepackaged cups.  But on the high side, I do get the have the coffee that I want, the way I want it. Which is great.

Summary: STALE
Review: I bought this to include in my daughter's party bag - It worked so well with the circus theme that we had.  Unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale.  When I heard this the first time I thought no way can't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then I heard it again from someone else.  Really disappointing.  I am so embarrassed.

Summary: An adequate product
Review: I purchased this product in the hope of utilizing it to produce yogurt. The yogurt produced by this product was very thin and could not be thickened using only culture.<br /><br />From the producers website<br /><br />"Note:  Goat milk yogurt is very thin, almost like kefir. For a thicker consistency, add 1 packet of unflavored gelatin dissolved in some of the scalded goat milk...."<br /><br />The product has a distinct aroma. Not terrible, but was stronger than comparable fresh goat milk. The flavor of the milk was only acceptable.<br /><br />In a pinch this product will suffice, however; I would not personally recommend it for regular consumption.

Summary: Not Jamaican at all, just another sweet, flavored coffee!
Review: I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!

Review: This huge bag of chocolates contained old (white and cracked) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag!  Noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross... what a waste and disappointment!  Will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again

Summary: Really Good Hazelnut Coffee
Review: Finally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.<br />Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.<br />The flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you don't like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)<br />The flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.<br />Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.<br />I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.<br />This one is a winner.

Summary: Flavored cofffee?
Review: I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.

Summary: Weird after taste, sugar substitute
Review: there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.

Summary: dripping in oil
Review: I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others.

Summary: Nice to find product thats safe
Review: Our older cat is having some health issues, which I "suspect" could have been caused by pet foods many of us buy in local stores. We've been on a mission to find a healthy pet food we could trust after all the pet food recalls. After going through way too many products trying to find one that did all it claimed to do, we found the PetGuard line of food. This one really does appear to be all it claims to be and our cats are thriving on it! Our older cat loves it and is acting more like a kitten than he's acted in years. Both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy, not to mention they love this stuff! Our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas.. But not this cat food! He isn't having any digestion problems at all..<br />Both our cats love the "fish,chicken & liver" dinner but our older cat isn't crazy about the "seafood savory dinner". He'll eat it but much prefers the fish,chicken and liver.<br />From my point of view, the fish, chicken and liver dinner doesn't smell too bad, but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad!<br />One problem I have with the food I've purchased from Amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented. I've purchased 2 cases and it's been the same with both cases.. I've purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can, so this seems to be an Amazon problem.. Not sure why, but some of the cans are really hard to open!<br />I'm relieved to finally find a food I'm not afraid to feed my pets.. I've read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans. That makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating.<br />UPDATE:<br />It's been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it. Amazon was out of stock once when I needed to reorder, so I purchased another organic brand. Not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand, but so did our 2 other cats. They would not eat the other kind, so when Pet Guard was back in stock, I ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties! They all love this stuff.. I think it stinks, but apparently, that's part of the attraction for them.

Summary: Not quite Old Dutch but much better than Herr's
Review: I LOVE Old Dutch Ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the US and pricey on eBay.  I tried Herr's but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that Old Dutch has (makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many!).  Uncle Rays are decent - more of a kick - many "loaded" chips which I like, still, not the addictive bite I love.  So - if you love Herr's these may be too much for you.  If you love Old Dutch give these a shot.  I am still on my quest for something equal to Old Dutch!!

Summary: Delicious IMO and.... helps weight loss
Review: If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- "De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight.
