	\section{Network Communities}
	Network Community detection was done by using Spectral Analysis. Specifically a User class was created to hold the basic information, the Username, the list of friends, the review and the summary. This is then used to load the users from the file.
	
	From that list of users an adjacency matrix is created based on who they are friends with. A row count diagonal matrix is created based on that adjacency matrix.
