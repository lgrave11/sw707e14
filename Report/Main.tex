	\chapter{Introduction}
	\input{Src/Introduction}
	\chapter{Analysis}
	This chapter includes analysis of the current system already in place in Aalborg, other existing systems, the problem definition, general requirements, and the target audience for the system.
	\input{Src/Analysis/CurrentSystem}
	\input{Src/Analysis/ExistingSystems}
	\input{Src/Analysis/ProblemDefinition}
	\input{Src/Analysis/Requirements}
	\input{Src/Analysis/TargetAudience}
	
	The report contains the following chapters:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Analysis - The analysis is documented, a problem definition and requirements are set up along with the target audience.
	\item Suggested Solutions - Solutions to different problems in the problem domain are suggested.
	\item Technologies - Different technologies and concepts used for this project are documented.
	\item Design - The design of the overall system is documented.
	\item Implementation - The implementation of the designed system is documented.
	\item Test - Unit testing and usability testing are both documented. 
	\item Discussion - Decisions about the overall system and why they were made are documented here, the developed system is compared to other existing systems and further development is documented.
	\item Conclusion - Conclude the report and answer the problem definition, and if the requirements were fulfilled along with if system criteria were upheld.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\chapter{Suggested Solutions}
	Various suggested extensions for the current system are proposed.
	These solutions are then in turn examined and evaluated, in order to determine if a solution is preferred to others and gives valuable information for the software system.
	An exception to this is the Booking Software examination, which makes a concrete choice on what solution to choose. 
	In order to determine which solution is preferable, a discussion of the solutions is performed, where after an overall chosen solution for the entire system is given.

	\chapter{Technologies}
	Some background material is needed for the development of a solution and this is examined and discussed. This includes a description of the Internet of Things and what issues that follow that is a description of the Model-View-Controller pattern used for the website, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML used for dynamic updating of webpages, and Simple Object Access Protocol to provide standardised webservices.

	\chapter{Design}
	This chapter presents the design of the product, where the conceptual design is described after which a prototype is presented.
    We also examine what the administration tools need to be able to do.
	Then the ER-diagram of the database is presented for both user and logging purposes. 
	The architecture is also explained for both the website and the simulated station software. 
	Finally an explanation of how the synchronisation between the central server and the client is going to be handled follows.

	\chapter{Implementation}
	This chapter covers implementation details for the features covered in the design chapter.
	This is covered by describing how we implement the UI, Website Structure, Database, Interfaces, Model View Controller, Google Maps API, Administration Tools, Station Software, and Synchronisation.

	\input{Src/Implementation/Database}

	\section{Model View Controller}
	The specific details of the MVC implementation is described hereafter. In this we touch upon how the implementation details differs from the overall MVC theory, but at the same time follows the design choices made. The description of MVC consists of the three subsections Model \& Model Services, Controller, and Views.

	\chapter{Test}
	Testing is an important aspect of ensuring that a system works correctly without unknown side effects.
	That is why it is important to verify that the model and interface layer works as intended, and can be done using unit testing, which is why we perform unit tests on those layers.
	
	While unit testing works for behavioural code and verifying that everything works correctly, we have an architecture that separates the behavioural aspects of the system away from the visual and experience aspects, specifically the controller and view layers.
	These layers also need to be tested, and unit testing does not fit well with them and as such a different way to test them is required, which is where usability testing comes into the picture because while they mostly reveal usability problems they can also reveal functionality errors where the system does not behave as expected. 
	As such usability tests are also performed.
