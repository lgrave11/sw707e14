	\chapter{Analysis}
	This chapter includes analysis of the current system already in place in Aalborg, other existing systems, the problem definition, general requirements, and the target audience for the system.

	\input{Src/Analysis/TargetAudience}
	
	\chapter{Suggested Solutions}
	Various suggested extensions for the current system are proposed.
	These solutions are then in turn examined and evaluated, in order to determine if a solution is preferred to others and gives valuable information for the software system.
	An exception to this is the Booking Software examination, which makes a concrete choice on what solution to choose. 
	In order to determine which solution is preferable, a discussion of the solutions is performed, where after an overall chosen solution for the entire system is given.

	\chapter{Technologies}
	Some background material is needed for the development of a solution and this is examined and discussed. This includes describing the Internet of Things and what issues follow that, a description of the Model-View-Controller pattern used for the website, and AJAX(aka dynamic updating of websites).

	\chapter{Design}
	This chapter will present the design of the product, where a prototype is created hereafter the ER-diagram of the database, also going into what they administration tools need to be able to do, the architecture is explained, and how synchronisation between the central server and the client is going to be handled.

	\chapter{Test}
	Testing is an important aspect of ensuring that a system works correctly and as intended without unknown side effects.
	That is why it is important to verify that the model and interface layer works as intended, this can be done using unit testing, which is why we perform unit tests on those layers.
	
	While unit testing works for behavioural code and verifying that everything works correctly there, we have an architecture that separates the behavioural aspects of the system away from the visual and experience aspects, specifically the controller and view layers.
	These layers also need to be tested, and unit testing does not fit well with them and as such a different way to test them is required, which is where usability testing comes into the picture because while they mostly reveal usability problems they can also reveal critical errors where the system does not behave as expected. 
	As such usability tests are also performed.
