\section{Unit Test}
Unit Tests are tests that are used to test the behaviour of the functions in a system.
When writing unit tests, the programmer sets up test cases and runs them through the function they are testing, and then compares the function output with the expected output.

As we have the source code of our program available, we have chosen the option of white-box testing.

The unit tests performed are performed on the model layer of the website aswell as the soap interface used to send messages to the station software.
As the tested parts are written in PHP, the PHPUnit testing framework is used for writing the tests.
