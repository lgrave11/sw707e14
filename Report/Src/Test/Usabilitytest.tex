\section{Usability Test}
This section covers the usability tests performed on the system.

These are the tasks:

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[Task 1] Blablabla
\item[Task 2] Blablabla
\item[Task 3] Blablabla
\item[Task 4] Blablabla
\end{description}

These tasks were given to a potential user and that user tried to perform them.
The problems were uncovered using Instant Data Analysis (IDA).
In IDA the procedure is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Test monitor introduces test subject to the evaluation procedure. After which the test monitor gives the first task to the test subject.
\item The test subject attempts to solve the task until they have accomplished it, feel they have accomplished it or until the test monitor gives them a new task.
\item Test subjects talk about what they are doing, explaining what they are doing and how they feel they understand the overall system. Test monitor does not help.
\item The test subject is interviewed and talk about their experience.
\end{itemize}\citep{misc:usabilitytest}

After the test, there is a meeting with the user where problems are discussed and which they felt were significant.
The result of an IDA is a set of usability problems categorized into one of three categories: Critical, Serious and Cosmetic.
We used IDA because it is quick and usually catches most of the usability problems a more rigorous approach would have caught.
