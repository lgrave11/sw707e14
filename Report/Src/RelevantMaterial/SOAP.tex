\section{Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)}
The \textbf{S}imple \textbf{O}bject \textbf{A}ccess \textbf{P}rotocol (SOAP) is a protocol for sending structured messages over a computer network using XML. 
The use of a SOAP helps structuring message passing, providing type information for contents. 

SOAP is useful because at the same time as allowing transmission of information, it also allows implementation of functionality for what is to be done once that information has been received.

A reason to use SOAP over other methods for transmitting information is because it provides more possibilities for security and is generally considered more reliable, and because it provides a standard use that makes it easier for new developers to pick it up. 
SOAP is generally considered slower and much more verbose than other methods.
Other methods on the other hand are generally more versatile when it comes to complex types, and is generally simpler, much less verbose and faster.

We chose to use SOAP because while other methods are less verbose, faster, and simpler, SOAP provides a standard protocol that while complex and verbose is a very big benefit.
