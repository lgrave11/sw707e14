\section{Asynchronous JavaScript and XML}
\textbf{A}synchronous \textbf{J}avaScript \textbf{a}nd \textbf{X}ML (AJAX) is a way to update parts of a web page without user interaction.
By using AJAX, parts of the web pages can be updated without reloading the whole web page every time, which makes the user experience of a website smoother.
Even though XML is a part of AJAX, it is not necessary to use when using AJAX, other methods to encode the data can be used, an example could be to use JSON, HTML, or plain text.
For the data transmission, data is obtained per request in some encoding, where the response can then be used by JavaScript to decode and reload the affected parts.

The reason to use AJAX is to improve the usability of a website, as well as the performance of a web page.
An example of this is when rating a film on IMDb \citep{misc:imdb} then when a user rates a movie, the web page does not reload, but instead utilises an asynchronous update to the database giving the user an non-interrupted experience.
AJAX should be used whenever the user interacts with something that does not need to update the entire page, but only update information on the database, this could be used when updating only a part of the web page.
