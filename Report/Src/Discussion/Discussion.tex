While developing the system, various problems were found, which may affect the applicability of the system.
Several of the problems were solved, but some problems still exist that may affect the applicability of the system in the Aalborg Bycykel domain.
For that reason, it is necessary to touch upon these issues and discuss what can be done differently, or why the chosen solution is sufficient.

In relation to this, implementation decisions made are discussed.
Additionally, the system is compared to the existing systems discussed in \secref{sec:existing-systems}, in order to determine the pros and cons of the developed system.

\section*{Booking Static}
A concern of Aalborg Kommune, mentioned in \secref{subsec:meetingaalborg}, is that the booking system might be too static.
By that meaning that too many bicycles are locked at docks instead of actively being used around Aalborg.
The problem with the system is that as the booking part of the website is used more, the system becomes more static.
Ways to ensure that the system stays a bit dynamic are one or more of the following, each of which are discussed in turn:

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
		\item[Lock late]
		The idea of this solution is to delay the locking of bicycles, reducing the static time each booking affects the system.
		However, the risk with this approach is that as you reduce the amount of time a bicycle is locked, you increase the risk of the bicycle not being available for the planned booking.
		This is a weighting you have to consider, but for the moment, the simulation of a station has a lock time of one hour before a bicycle is planned to be obtained.
		Alone, this solution is not desireable, as you have no way of detecting how many bicycles are available in the future.
		To compensate this, the lock time could wary if you were to integrate the locking mechanism with GPS tracking, and is related to the latter point about prediction.
