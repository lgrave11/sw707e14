While developing the system, various problems were found, which may affect the functionality of the system.
Several of the problems were solved, but some problems still exist that may affect the functionality of the system in the Aalborg Bycykel domain.
For that reason, it is necessary to touch upon these issues and discuss what can be done differently, or why the chosen solution is sufficient.

In relation to this, implementation decisions made are discussed.
Additionally, the system is compared to the existing systems discussed in \secref{sec:existing-systems}, in order to determine the pros and cons of the developed system.
Moreover decisions about what should be implemented in the future to support or improve the system is discussed in \secref{sec:furdev}.

\section*{Booking Static}
A concern of Aalborg Kommune, mentioned in \secref{subsec:meetingaalborg}, is that the booking system might be too static.
By that meaning that too many bicycles are locked at docks instead of actively being used around Aalborg.
The problem with the system is that as the booking part of the website is used more, the system becomes more static.
Ways to ensure that the system stays a bit dynamic are one or more of the following, each of which are discussed in turn:

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
		\item[Lock late]
		The idea of this solution is to delay the locking of bicycles, reducing the static time each booking affects the system.
		However, the risk with this approach is that as you reduce the amount of time a bicycle is locked, you increase the risk of the bicycle not being available for the planned booking.
		This is something to consider, but for the moment, the simulation of a station has a lock time of one hour before a bicycle is planned to be obtained.
		Alone, this solution is not desirable, as you have no way of detecting how many bicycles are available in the future.
		To compensate this, the lock time could vary if you were to integrate the locking mechanism with GPS tracking, and is related to the latter point about prediction.
		
		\item[Subset of bicycles for booking]
		The idea here is to only allow a subset of the amount of bicycles on a station to be booked, this could for instance be that at all times at most half of the bicycles on a station can be booked.
		There are a few different approaches to how this could be handled.
		One option is to simply exclude some of the docks from the system, so that at each station some of the docks physically placed at the station will not be in the system.
		Another option is that the system itself keeps track of how many bicycles are currently at each station, and then it cannot lock anymore than a predefined percentage of these.
		The problem with the first option is that the system cannot accurately tell how many bicycles are available at a station, if it does not have access to read from all the docks.
		The problem with the second approach is that it is difficult for users of the website to know when a booking is possible as the amount of lockable bicycles at each station is dynamically updating.
		This leads to a third option, which is a combination of the first two.
		This option is that each station has a set amount of bicycles that it can lock.
		As this a fixed amount, it is possible to predict if a bicycle can be locked at the given time and due to this, it is possible to inform users at the time of booking creation, whether the booking was successful or not, but also give a status of how many bicycles are available for booking and how many are free to take.
		
		\item[Prediction]
		The idea here is that if you are able to predict when bicycles are returning to the station, you can unlock bicycles on that basis.
		An example of this is that you have a booking in 15 minutes, there is one bicycle left at the station. Then since you know that a bicycle returns to the station in about 5 minutes, the last remaining bicycle can be unlocked for use.
		How you are then able to predict this could be with use of GPS tracking and substantial statistical analysis.
		However, it is a project on its own, but is elaborated a bit further in \secref{subsec:prediction}.

\section*{Website Designed for PC}
At the current stage, the website part of the system have been designed with a PC in mind.
However, it is evident that there is a tendency to more people using smartphones and tablets \citep{article:smartphonetabletincrease}.
For that reason, it would be a good idea to design the website such that it is also easy to use for such devices.
There are several ways to tackle this, each of which are discussed in turn.

	\item[Seperate App]

\section*{Hardware vs. Simulation}
One aspect of the system implemented that would have to be changed in the situation that the system was put into actual use, would be the simulation of the hardware.
Specifically, the station, docks, and bicycles are all simulated and in the real world these would need to be changed to be real hardware.
The simulation is done by have multiple programs behaving somewhat similar to how the real world would interact with the system.
An example of this is the bicycle, the bicycle should upload its GPS coordinates to the system every now and then, a program was created to upload GPS coordinates that are loaded from a file instead of a real bicycle reporting the actual coordinates.

A big difference between the simulation and the hardware going to be used, is how the simulation works.
For example the simulation of all the stations is implemented in a single program that handles all interaction. 
This would, however, not be the case in the real world where each station would have its own software.
However, this problem was thought of in the development of the station software, such that each station has its own ip address, and can therefore work even if multiple computers are running the station software. As the central server requests the right IP address when sending a booking/unbooking to the station.

The simulation is done such that the development of this system does not require real station hardware.
Furthermore, this project is a software development project, and therefore hardware is not the focus of this project.
For this purpose of this project the simulation is considered sufficient because it allows the system to be interacted with as it is supposed to be in the real world without making it needlessly complex, for example by having to run multiple stations at the same time on several different computers.
