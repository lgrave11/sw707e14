\section{Chosen Solution}
To provide the project with valuable information about how the project could work in the real world, we will also choose a solution for the hardware elements.
This is despite the fact that only the website will actually be developed, along with the API that the hardware will use plus some simulated hardware elements.

For the availability of bicycles, we choose to have docks since it also covers part of the hardware aspect of a different requirement, remote locking.  
For remote locking we also choose to use passwords that need to be input at the station because it is something everyone can do once the booking has been done, as SMS, QR codes, and GPS require phones and might not be suitable for tourists.
If it comes to tracking of bicycles we choose GPS because it requires much less than WiFi to make a reality.

The following provides an overview of the chosen solution using rich pictures.

The server-station relationship is shown in \figref{fig:ServerRichPicture}. 
The server contains collected information from each station, such as bookings, amount of available bicycles at stations, and usage statistics.
It provides booking and amount of available bicycles at stations through a website to the user. 
Usage statistics are provided to the facilitators of the system and gives them the ability to improve it.

The stations receive the information that allows it to handle bookings done on the server.
They also have the capability of handling booking by themselves, which is then shared with the central server.
Sharing information such as the amount of available bicycles is also something the stations need to be able to do.
The dock that provide the locking/unlocking mechanism along with the bicycle detection ability have to talk to the station, for example when they need to unlock booked bicycle this information needs to be propagated from the server to the station to the individual bicycle.
This can be seen in \figref{fig:StationRichPicture}.
