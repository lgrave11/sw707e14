\section{Tracking Of Bicycles}
In order to counter the loss of bicycles, tracking of the bicycles could be used.
With the tracking, lost bicycles could be located and reinserted into a station.
Furthermore, the tracking can be used for analysis of the bicycling patterns, to see where most bicycles travel to, indicating new hot spots for placing of stations.
Additionally, the tracking can be used to foresee when a bicycle comes to a given station, informing waiting bicycle users of when a new bicycle is ready for use.

Tracking systems which are analysed is GPS and WiFi, and follows hereafter.
\subsection{GPS}
GPS (Global Positioning System) satellites are floating around the earth.
It can be be used to locate the position of a bicycle.
If you equip the bicycle with a retriever it can use the retrieved GPS signals from some of the satellites to estimate the position.
GPS only works when outside, but as you are outside when you bicycle this is not a problem.

The GPS satellites are already floating around the earth, and as of such does not need to be invested in.
For each bicycle it is sufficient to have a GPS retriever to calculate the position, and of course power for it.
Then to report the calculated position, some connection to the developed system would have to exist.
\subsection{WiFi}
Tracking with Wifi is another technique that could be used.
The idea here is to place beacons around the city.
The beacons can then retrieve WiFi signals from a bicycle, and use this to determine the location of the bicycle.

The pro of this type of tracking is that you are not dependent on some externals beacons you do not owen.
On the contrary, you would have to place beacons all around the city of Aalborg in order to precisely locate a bicycle.
Furthermore, you would still need a wifi sender on each bicycle, and as of such you increase the amount of equipment needed to track the bicycles.

\subsection{Chosen Solution}
If tracking of bicycles is implemented, it is found that GPS is the preferred solution, as it can utilise the already existing satellites, and as bicycling is performed outside, the GPS tracking will work most of the time.
