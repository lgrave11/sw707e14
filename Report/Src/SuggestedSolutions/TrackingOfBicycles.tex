\section{Tracking of Bicycles}
In order to counter the loss of bicycles, tracking of the bicycles could be used.
With tracking, lost bicycles can be located and reused in the system.
Furthermore, tracking can be used for analysis of the bicycling patterns, to see where most bicycles travel to, indicating hotspots for potential placement of new stations, expansion of stations, and removal of old ones.
Additionally, tracking can be used to give an estimate of when a bicycle may arrive at a given station, opening up the possibility of providing waiting users with information about when a new bicycle might be ready for use.

\subsection{GPS}
GPS satellites are in orbit around the Earth, and is used for navigation purposes because it provides a reasonably accurate position of objects on the ground.
In addition to this, it could be used to determine the position of a bicycle, though it would require some kind of GPS device being attached to the bicycle.
This could then be used to find lost bicycles.
GPS usually only works when outside, but as you bicycle outside this is not a problem \citep{misc:howgpsworks}.

For each bicycle it is sufficient to have a GPS device used to determine the position and a power source for it.
Then to report the position, some connection to the developed system would have to exist.
