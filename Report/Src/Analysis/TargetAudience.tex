\section{Target Audience}
The target audience for this project are the regular users of \bycykelwithoutspace, such as tourists and other people in Aalborg that do not have other means of transportation immediately available to them. 
Thus, we strive to develop a system that meets their needs.
In that category goes low-cost and easy access for tourists.
In general we will strive to develop the system for users who are not particularly tech savvy, because if the solution works for them, it probably will for most other users as well.

Additionally, the organizations running \bycykel are also part of the target audience, but that is in the context of managing the system, and not for the general use of the system, so this group is a secondary priority.
