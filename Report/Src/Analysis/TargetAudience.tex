\section{Target Audience}
The target audience for this project are the regular users of \bycykelwithoutspace, such as tourists and other people in Aalborg that do not have other means of transportation immediately available to them. 
Thus, we strive to develop a system that meets their needs.
In that category goes low-cost and easy access for tourists.
In general we strive to develop the booking part of the system for users who are not particularly tech-savvy, because if the solution works for them, it probably will for most other users as well.

Additionally, the organizations running \bycykel are also part of the target audience, and is kept in mind for the administration part of the system.
