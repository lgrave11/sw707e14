\section{Requirements}
A few criteria have been made, that a system for the \bycykel should be able to fulfil. 
In addition to this, the requirements are listed with the highest priority first, such that the goal for the product is to fulfil the requirements in the listed order. 
Therefore not all requirements will necessarily be fulfilled as time is limited.
We do not make any decisions on the hardware.
We do, however, come up with some requirements for the hardware but how exactly they are fulfilled is beyond our field of study.
Although a set of criteria for the entire system will be discussed and set up for the different software and hardware solutions to conform to.

\subsection{System Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A chosen solution should not redesign the entire existing system but rather just add a light weight solution to the existing system. By a light weight solution  we mean a solution that require a minimum of additions to the existing system in terms of hardware.
	\item A solution should be easy to use by the end user and easy to access by everyone. It should only require a few steps in the process of borrowing a bicycle.
	\item A solution should not rely on t
\end{itemize}

The system should be able to:
\begin{description}
\item[See how many bicycles are available at a given station] \hfill \\
The users should be able to see how many bicycles are available at a given station.
This could be done through a web service.
\item[Obtain data for statistical analysis] \hfill \\
The system should be able to collect information and statistics about the usage of the system.
Aalborg Kommune should be able to use this information to e.g. perform analysis about where to redistribute bicycles and to determine if purchase of new bicycles is necessary.
\item[Give the possibility of booking a bicycle] \hfill \\
This could be done through the same web service where the user is able to see how many bicycles are available.
A booked bicycle should be locked and unavailable for everyone except the one who booked it.
\item[Track bicycles through for example GPS] \hfill \\
The data collected by the positioning system will be used to locate the bicycles if someone forgets to return it.
\item[Predict availability of bicycles depending on placement and other variables] \hfill \\
The position will be used for predicting the usage of the bicycles as well. 
For example to predict when a bicycle will be available at a given station again.
