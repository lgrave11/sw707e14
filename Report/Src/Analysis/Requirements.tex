\section{Requirements}
A few criteria have been made, that a system for the Aalborg city bikes should be able to fulfil. In addition to this, the requirements were put into two categories, simple and advanced, and developers should prioritise simple requirements before advanced ones.

Simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item Be able to see how many bikes are available at a given station.
\item Be able to generate data for statistical analysis.
\item Give the possibility of booking a bike, so the user is certain that one is ready at the chosen station.
\end{itemize}

Advanced:
\begin{itemize}
\item Track bikes through fx GPS
\item Predict availability of bikes depending on placement and other variables
\item Use predicted availability to improve booking system.
\end{itemize}
