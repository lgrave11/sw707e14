The bicycle stations are design so they can be placed everywhere in the cities without doing any preparation, since they get electricity from solar panels.
Furthermore, the stations are using a cellular connection to upload their data to the main database, so the citizens can see if there are any bikes at a given station.
To rent a bicycle from one of Alta Bicycle Shares system you have to use a card, which can be brought in shops nearby the stations.
These cards then give access to any bicycle for a given time at any station, however, using the bicycle for a longer period of time can lead to a fee.
