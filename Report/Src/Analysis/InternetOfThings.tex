\section{The Internet of Things}
The Internet of Things (the IoT) is the concept describing the interconnection of uniquely identifiable objects in the real world along with their virtual representation and the interfaces that allow for manipulation and/or information retrieval regarding those objects. This is done using various protocols in several different domains used in multiple applications \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsDefinition} \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsDefinition2} \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsDefinition3}.

The IoT manifests as subsystems to provide some public service or good, either by informing the user regarding objects in the real world or allowing an intelligent system to manage those objects. An example of this could be a so-called 'smart home' that allows you to use a single device to manage the connected objects in your home, such as the lights or the oven in the kitchen \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsExamples}.
