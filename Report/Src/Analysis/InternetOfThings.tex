\section{The Internet of Things}
The Internet of Things (the IoT) is the concept describing the interconnection of uniquely identifiable objects in the real world along with their virtual representation and the interfaces that allow for manipulation and/or information retrieval regarding those objects. This is done using various protocols in several different domains used in multiple applications \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsDefinition} \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsDefinition2} \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsDefinition3}.

The IoT manifests as subsystems to provide some public service or good, either by informing the user regarding objects in the real world or allowing an intelligent system to manage those objects. An example of this could be a so-called 'smart home' that allows you to use a single device to manage the connected objects in your home, such as the lights or the oven in the kitchen \citep{misc:InternetOfThingsExamples}. One society-wide use for it is the idea of a 'Smart Grid', where the electricity usage is monitored and managed by an intelligent system that will for example purchase more electricity from neighboring countries if internal electricity production can not keep up with usage.

In the real world there are already a lot of objects on the IoT, and by 2020 it is estimated that there will be upwards of around 26-30 billion thing \citep{misc:IoTGrowth1}\citep{misc:IoTGrowth2} and this will require a jump to the IPv6 protocol as the amount of IP addresses are severely limited by IPv4\citep{misc:numberOfAddresses}.

One important aspect of the objects connected to the IoT will be how they are connected, here WiFi or mobile networking will not work well as they will likely interfere with one another. The connectivity technology have to be low-power, cheap and non-interfering. One way to do that would be to directly connect objects to a server of some sort that is connected to the internet, though that is not practical for objects that must be mobile. 

The spatial location in the IoT is critical, especially for sensor objects where the location provides important context for the information of which something/someone is accessing. For example if there is a station for bikes in a bike sharing system that needs to provide information regarding the amount of bikes at the station, it is critical that it also provides the actual location of the station or the information will not be of any use.
