\section{Controller}
This section will show how the controller layer works. For more detail about Model-View-Controller architecture, see \secref{sec:mvc}.

In \lstref{lst:homeController}, part of the Home Controller can be seen. 
It defines an `action', this action is what is pointed to by the client. 
For space saving purposes all actions but the index action have been removed.
It then uses two services. 
The StationService is used to retrieve an array of all stations(lines 8--9), and the BookingService is used to retrieve an array of all active bookings for the currently logged in user(lines 11-14). 
This illustrates the general idea behind the separation of the entities(The Models) and the services corresponding to those models. '
It then uses the information loaded by 'including' views, and these views then use the information for displaying.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=php, label=lst:homeController, caption={Home Controller Class}]
<?php
class Home extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $this->title = "Home";
        $currentPage = substr($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"], 1);
        $stationService = new StationService($this->db);
        $stations = $stationService->readAllStations();

        if (Tools::isLoggedIn()) {
            $bookingService = new BookingService($this->db);
            $activeBookings = $bookingService->getActiveBookings($_SESSION["login_user"]);
        }

        // load views. within the views we can echo out $songs and $amount_of_songs easily
        require 'application/views/_templates/header.php';
        require 'application/views/home/index.php';
        require 'application/views/_templates/footer.php';
    }
    // [...]
}
\end{lstlisting}

What views look like will be illustrated in the next section.
