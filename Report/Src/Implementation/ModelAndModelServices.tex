\section{Model \& Model Services}\fxwarning{Det er for redeg√∏rende}
This section describe the model layer.
It will illustrate this by giving an example model, showing what it looks like and what it does and then illustrating the corresponding service.
Furthermore, a diagram of the model layer can be seen in \appref{app-arch:model}.

The Bicycle entity class can be seen in \lstref{lst:bicycleModel}.
And as can be seen, what it does is to capture the attributes of the Bicycle entity from the database.

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=php, label=lst:bicycleModel, caption={Bicycle Class}]
<?php
class Bicycle
{
    public $bicycle_id = null;
    public $longitude = null;
    public $latitude = null;

    function __construct($bicycle_id, $latitude, $longitude){
        $this->bicycle_id = $bicycle_id;
        $this->longitude = $longitude;
        $this->latitude = $latitude;
    }
}
?>
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

An overview of how the general structure of the CRUD methods implemented in the Model Services is described here, and gives you an idea of how the controller parts of the website have services available that can work on the model.

\textbf{CRUD}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[Create]
	As input parameter you get an object of the given entity to be created, e.g. Bicycle.
	This fields of this object is then used to insert the object into the database.
	
	\item[Read]
	As input parameter you get the primary key of the desired entity to be read.
	This primary key is then used to select the corresponding row from the database.
	
	\item[Update]
	As input parameter you get an object of the given entity to be updated.
	One of the attributes of the object correponds to the primary key of corresponding table in the database.
	This attribute is used to identify the object, where an update query is then used to update the given row to the attributes of the input object.
	
	\item[Delete]
	As input parameter you get the primary key of the desired entity to be deleted.
	This primary key is then used to delete the corresponding from the the database.

With the model layer described, we take a look at how the controllers are constructed, and how they use the model layer.
