\section{Views}
This section will describe the view layer and what it does, illustrating by example. For more detail about Model-View-Controller architecture, see \secref{sec:mvc}.

In \lstref{lst:homeIndexView} a truncated version of the home index view can be seen. Most of it is normal HTML, but the important part is how it utilizes variables set in the controller, that once the view is included it gets access to. This allows it to use them to generate more HTML as can be seen lines 6--10 where it uses the array of stations set in the controller to output option elements in a select element, and it can also use methods defined as shown in line 13--19.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=html, label=lst:homeIndexView, caption={Home Index View}]
[...]
<form action="/Home/Book/" method="post">
    [...]
    <select name="station" id="stations" style="width: 243px;" onchange="UpdateMarker()">
    <option value="0" disabled selected>- Select Station -</option>
    <?php
    foreach($stations as $station){
        echo '<option value="'.$station->station_id.'">'.$station->name.'</option>';
    }
    ?>
    </select><br />
    [...]
    <?php
        if (Tools::isLoggedIn()){
            echo '<input type="submit" value="Book" />';
        } else {
            echo '<a href="/User/Login/">Login</a>';
        }
    ?>
    [...]
</form>
[...]
\end{lstlisting}
