\section{Bicycle Simulation}
Part of the problem domain are the bicycles themselves, specifically one of the requirements for the system is that the bicycles can be tracked.
One aspect of tracking bicycles is displaying historical data and how this is managed on the administrative side of things, for more detail about this see \secref{sec:impAdminTools}.
Another aspect is what interface the bicycles need to report their position, which can be read about in \secref{subsec:bicycletodatabase}. 
Given those two, we also need to simulate bicycles in some way.
To do this, a program was made where the user can pick which bicycles to move. 
This program also includes various routes following roads in Aalborg, such that the position reported is realistic.
