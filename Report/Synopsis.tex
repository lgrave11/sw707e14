% Motivation
The bicycle share system in Aalborg is generally subpar compared to other similar systems, to improve it would generally make it easier to use and run.

% Problem statement
In other systems, such as the Gobike in Copenhagen the system uses GPS tracking, routing and other generally useful features. 
To create a website and a supporting system allowing for tracking, booking and other such features would generally improve the existing system and is attempted.

% Approach
To do this we made a website, and supporting software for simulating stations and bicycles. We made a booking solution for the users of the system, and for the administrators we created pages to provide overview of the system on a whole.
