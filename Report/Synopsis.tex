% Motivation
The bicycle share system in Aalborg is generally subpar compared to other similar systems.
To improve it would provide a better experience for the users.

% Problem statement
In other systems, such as the Gobike in Copenhagen uses GPS tracking, routing and other generally useful features. 
To create a website and a supporting system allowing for tracking, booking and other such features would improve the existing system and is attempted.

% Approach
To resolve this we develop a booking and administration website for \bycykelwithoutspace, and software for simulating stations and bicycles. We made a booking solution for the users of the system, and for the administrators we created pages to provide overview of the system on a whole.

% Results
The website ended up having many features supporting the use and administration of the system.
