% Motivation
The bicycle share system in Aalborg is generally subpar compared to other similar systems.
To improve it would provide a better experience for the users.

% Problem statement
Other systems, such as the Gobike in Copenhagen, uses GPS tracking, routing, and other generally useful features. 
To create a website and a supporting system, which allows for tracking, booking, and other such features, would improve the existing system.

% Approach
To resolve this we develop a booking and administration website for \bycykelwithoutspace, and software for simulating stations and bicycles. We made a booking solution for the users of the system, and for the administrators we created pages to provide overview of the system on a whole.

% Results
The website ended up having many features supporting the use and administration of the system.
