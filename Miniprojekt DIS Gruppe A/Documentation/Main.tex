	\begin{itemize}
	\item Sales
	\item Payments
	\item Members
	\item Location
	\end{itemize}
	
	We pick the 'Sales' business process, because it is the most interesting. Granularity with regards to time sales it is important to have a lot of detail, so we choose the specific date and time. ?? Is it reasonable for a paying customer???  
	
	Examples of questions:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item How much is bought at some point during some day?
	\item How does the amount sold change over time?
	\item Which days are the most busy?
	\item When is it best to restock, given low activity?
	\item How much revenue is gained each day, week, month, year?
	\item Which products have changed the most in price from year to year?
	\item Which department or member have spent the most?
	\end{itemize}
